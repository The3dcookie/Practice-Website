        You roll your eyes to see
        If there's a place for me inside
        I'm cold as ice but the heat
        Will melt me down this time
        And now I'll fit right in
        An hourglass, in the shape of my outfit
        We'll outlast the trials and tribulations
        Let the time rush in
        Let the time rush in
        You freeze when danger knocks at your door
        The pent-up pain is keeping it closed
        Let the stranger out of the mold
        Let the stranger out of the mold
        You freeze when danger knocks at your door
        The pent-up pain is keeping it closed
        Let the stranger out of the mold
        Let the stranger out of the mold
        I fantasize to see
        If there's a space for me in mind
        I held on tight to memories
        That made my alibi
        But now I take the blame
        An era full of misery and shame
        From here on out, I will not fit that frame
        Let the time reclaim
        Let the time reclaim
        You freeze when danger knocks at your door
        The pent-up pain is keeping it closed
        Let the stranger out of the mold
        Let the stranger out of the mold
        You freeze when danger knocks at your door
        The pent-up pain is keeping it closed
        Let the stranger out of the mold
        Let the stranger out of the mold
        You freeze when danger knocks at your door
        The pent-up pain is keeping it closed
        Let the stranger out of the mold
        Let the stranger out of the mold
        You freeze when danger knocks at your door
        The pent-up pain is keeping it closed
        Let the stranger out of the mold
        Let the stranger out of the mold
