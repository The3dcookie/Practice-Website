            On the midnight train
            Only love's in my way
            Picture-perfect world
            Crop me out of the frame
            And no, it's not to say
            Things will never change
            I'm afraid this time
            It'd take an act of fate


            On the midnight train
            Dopamine in my brain
            Special K, full tank
            Give to sol my thanks
            And though it's not your thing
            I don't hesitate
            I'm afraid this time
            It'll be too late


            How could I trust myself?
            Runnin' right off of the rails
            How could I break the spell?
            Up this high, the ride prevails


            On the midnight train
            Fire and ice in my veins
            Pretty name, new flame
            Pretty out of my lane
            And though it don't equate
            I am lost by grace
            I'm afraid this time
            Things will be too grave


            How could I trust myself?
            Runnin' right off of the rails
            How could I break the spell?
            Up this high, the ride prevails


            I can't slow up, I need you show up
            I can't slow up, I need you show up
            I can't slow up, I need you show up
            I can't slow the ride

            
            How could I trust myself? (I can't slow up, I need you show up)
            (I can't slow up, I need you show up)
            Runnin' right off of the rails (I can't slow the ride)
            (I can't slow up, I need you show up)
            How could I break the spell? (I can't slow up, I need you show up)
            (I can't slow up, I need you show up)
            Up this high, the ride (I can't slow the ride)
